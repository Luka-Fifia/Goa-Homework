    <p>The unicorn among BMW M3 E46 models.   The unicorn among BMW M3 E46 models. No air conditioning, no radio, no rear seats. But under the bonnet of this rare BMW M3 E46 roars a V8. <br>
        Hot air shimmers over the asphalt. After the Bavarian fireball has passed the last bend before the start-finish line, we hear the unmistakeable roar of the V8 engine. Tension in the pit lane. Then, finally, certainty: at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March 2001, the BMW M3 GTR, helmed by JJ Lehto and Jörg Müller, finishes on the podium in its first race. The team embrace. They all know: This is the start of a new era in American motorsport. From now on, this vehicle owns the racetracks of the American Le Mans Series. Victories in this series were the highest accolade for the US market. But the way there was hard and the effort required enormous. The extraordinary story of the BMW M3 GTR.
