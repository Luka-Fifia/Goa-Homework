        <h1>Antelope</h1>
        <p>
            An antelope is a member of a diverse group of herbivorous mammals belonging to the family Bovidae, which
            includes gazelles, impalas, and elands. They are found primarily in Africa and parts of Asia. Antelopes are
            known for their slender bodies, long legs, and impressive agility, which help them evade predators.

                <strong>Speed:</strong> Many antelopes, like the cheetah's prey, are incredibly fast. For instance, the
                Thomsonâ€™s gazelle
                can reach speeds up to 80 km/h (50 mph).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Horns:</strong> Most species have horns, which are often used for defense and territorial
                battles. Unlike deer, their horns are permanent and not shed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Social Behavior:</strong> Antelopes often live in herds, which offers protection against predators.
