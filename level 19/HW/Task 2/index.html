            <p>
                The Hobbit is a series of three fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. The films are
                subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five
                Armies (2014).[5] The films are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel The Hobbit, but much of the
                trilogy was inspired by the appendices to his 1954â€“55 The Lord of the Rings, which expand on the story
                told in The Hobbit. Additional material and new characters were created specially for the films. The
                series is a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.

                Filming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Principal photography began on 21 March 2011 in Wellington, New Zealand. Filming took place at
                Wellington Stone Street Studios, the town of Matamata and at other undisclosed locations around New
                Zealand.[155] <br> <br>

                The costumes for each of the Dwarves included six wigs and eight beards, which were worn by the actors,
                stunt doubles, and stand-ins.[156]

            <p>
                The music of The Hobbit film series was composed, produced and (in the case of the first film)
                orchestrated and conducted by Howard Shore, who scored all three The Lord of the Rings films. Recording
                sessions for the first film began on 20 August 2012, at Abbey Road Studios.[187] The second and third
                films were recorded in New Zealand.

                Release
            </h2>
            <p>
                The world premiere for The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey took place on 28 November 2012 in Wellington,
                New Zealand,[199] with the film's wide release in New Zealand on 12 December.[200] 100,000 people lined
                the red carpet on Wellington's Courtenay Place for the premiere.[201] The entire event was also
                broadcast live on TV3 (New Zealand), and streamed over the Internet.[202] Tickets to the film's midnight
                screenings in New Zealand sold out within minutes of going on sale, prompting director Peter Jackson to
                say that the fans who missed out "may get something special" which could include getting to see the film
                "possibly even a minute or two before anyone else".[203] The film was released on 13 December 2012 in
                the United Kingdom[204] and 14 December 2012 for some other parts of the world.[102] It has a runtime of
                169 minutes (2 hours and 49 minutes).[205] The film has grossed over $1 billion at the box office,
                surpassing both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers nominally.[206]
