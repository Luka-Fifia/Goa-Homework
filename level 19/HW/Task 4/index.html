                Academy
            </h2>
            <p>
                An academy (Attic Greek: Ἀκαδήμεια; Koine Greek Ἀκαδημία) is an institution of secondary or tertiary
                higher learning (and generally also research or honorary membership). The name traces back to Plato's
                school of philosophy, founded approximately 386 BC at Akademia, a sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of
                wisdom and skill, north of Athens, Greece. <br> <br>

                The Royal Spanish Academy defines academy as scientific, literary or artistic society established with
                public authority and as a teaching establishment, public or private, of a professional, artistic,
                technical or simply practical nature.

                Etymology
            </h2>
            <p>
                The word comes from the Academy in ancient Greece, which derives from the Athenian hero, Akademos.
                Outside the city walls of Athens, the gymnasium was made famous by Plato as a center of learning. The
                sacred space, dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Athena, had formerly been an olive grove, hence the
                expression "the groves of Academe".

            <h2>
                Original Academy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before Akademia was a school, and even before Cimon enclosed its precincts with a wall,[3] it contained
                a sacred grove of olive trees dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, outside the city walls of
                ancient Athens.[4] The archaic name for the site was Hekademia, which by classical times evolved into
                Akademia and was explained, at least as early as the beginning of the 6th century BC, by linking it to
                an Athenian hero, a legendary "Akademos". The site of Akademia was sacred to Athena and other immortals.

                Literary-philosophical academies (17th century)
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the 17th century the tradition of literary-philosophical academies, as circles of friends gathering around learned patrons, was continued in Italy; the "Umoristi" (1611), the "Fantastici (1625), and the "Ordinati", founded by Cardinal Dati and Giulio Strozzi. About 1700 were founded the academies of the "Infecondi", the "Occulti", the "Deboli", the "Aborigini", the "Immobili", the "Accademia Esquilina", and others. During the 18th century many Italian cities established similar philosophical and scientific academies. In the first half of the 19th century some of these became the national academies of pre-unitarian states: the academy of Accesi became the Panomitan Academy of Buon Gusto (Trento); the academy of Timidi became the Royal Academy of Mantua; the Accademia dei Ricovrati became the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science (Padova); the academy of Dissonanti became the Royal Academy of Modena and the academy of Oscuri became the Royal Academy of Lucca.

                Structure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Academia is usually conceived as divided into disciplines or fields of study. These have their roots in the subjects of the medieval trivium and quadrivium, which provided the model for scholastic thought in the first universities in medieval Europe. <br> <br>

                The disciplines have been much revised, and many new disciplines have become more specialized, researching smaller and smaller areas. Because of this, interdisciplinary research is often prized in today's academy, though it can also be made difficult both by practical matters of administration and funding and by differing research methods of different disciplines. In fact, many new fields of study have initially been conceived as interdisciplinary, and later become specialized disciplines in their own right – a recent example is cognitive science. <br> <br>
                
                Most academic institutions reflect the divide of the disciplines in their administrative structure, being divided internally into departments or programs in various fields of study. Each department is typically administered and funded separately by the academic institution, though there may be some overlap and faculty members, research and administrative staff may in some cases be shared among departments. In addition, academic institutions generally have an overall administrative structure (usually including a president and several deans) which is controlled by no single department, discipline, or field of thought. Also, the tenure system, a major component of academic employment and research in the US, serves to ensure that academia is relatively protected from political and financial pressures on thought. <br> <br>
