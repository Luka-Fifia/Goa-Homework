            <p>
                Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that
                computers can follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms,
                step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages.
                Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans
                than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming
                usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
                details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music
                sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute
                player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[3][4] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a
                programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms
                and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[5][6] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different
                weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them. <br> <br>

                Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician
                Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on
                Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency
                analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm. <br> <br>

                The first computer program is generally dated to 1843 when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an
                algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's
                Analytical Engine.[8] However, Charles Babbage himself had written a program for the AE in 1837. <br>
                <br>

                In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[11] Later
                a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for
                different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were
                programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the
                concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and
                manipulated in the same way in computer memory. <br> <br>

                The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are concerned with discovering
                and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problems. For this purpose,
                algorithms are classified into orders using Big O notation, which expresses resource use—such as
                execution time or memory consumption—in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar
                with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge
                to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.

            <p>
                The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by
                testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a
                lot of different approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is
                Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of
                formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather
                than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process. <br> <br>

                Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven
                Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.
                <br> <br>

                A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling). <br> <br>

                Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional
                languages, and logic programming languages. <br> <br>

                Measuring language usage
            </h2>
            <p>
                It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular modern programming languages. Methods of
                measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that
                mention the language,[23] the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates
                the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the
                language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL). <br> <br>

                Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly
                used to write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data
                centers[24] often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages
                in Web development, and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in
                their construction and use. New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language
                with new functionality added, (for example C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory
                management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency and the ability for low-level
                manipulation).
