                A <strong>frog</strong> is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied,
                tailless
                amphibians
                composing the order Anura[1] (coming from the Ancient Greek ἀνούρα, literally 'without tail'). The
                oldest
                fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar (250 million years
                ago),
                but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend further back to the
                Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic
                regions,
                but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account for around
                88%
                of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog
                species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from
                taxonomy
                or evolutionary history.

                An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath,
                and no
                tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with
                secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled
                brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off
                predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living
                underground
                or in trees.

                Frogs typically lay their eggs in the water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that
                have
                tails and internal gills. They have highly specialised rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous,
                omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few
                species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet
                consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on plant matter. Frog
                skin
                has a rich microbiome which is important to their health. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting
                what
                they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators and part of the food web
                dynamics
                of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration,
                so
                they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a
                wide
                range of vocalisations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of
                complex
                behaviors to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.

                Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and
                religion.
                They are also seen as environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often viewed as early
                warning signs of environmental damage. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s.
                More
                than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and over 120 are believed to
                have
                become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging
                fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to
                understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.
