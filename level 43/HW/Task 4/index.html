                <strong>Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings PLC (/ˈæstən/)</strong> is a British manufacturer of luxury
                sports cars and
                grand tourers. Its predecessor was founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. Steered from
                1947 by David Brown, it became associated with expensive grand touring cars in the 1950s and 1960s, and
                with the fictional character James Bond following his use of a DB5 model in the 1964 film
                Goldfinger. Their grand tourers and sports cars are regarded as a British cultural icon.

                Rover Gaydon Centre.[13] The old 3.6-acre (1.5 ha) facility in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, is the
