                <strong>Belgian</strong> cuisine is widely varied among regions, while also reflecting the cuisines of
                neighbouring
                France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the
                more hearty Flemish fare. Outside the country, Belgium is best known for its chocolate, waffles, fries
                and beer.

                Though Belgium has many distinctive national dishes, many internationally popular foods like hamburgers
                and spaghetti bolognese are also popular in Belgium, and most of what Belgians eat is also eaten in
                neighbouring countries. "Belgian cuisine" therefore usually refers to dishes of Belgian origin, or those
                considered typically Belgian.

                Belgian cuisine traditionally prizes regional and seasonal ingredients. Ingredients typical in Belgian
                dishes include potatoes, leeks, grey shrimp, white asparagus, Belgian endive, horse meat and local beer,
                in addition to common European staples including meat, cheese and butter. Belgians typically eat four
                meals a day, with a light breakfast, medium lunch, a snack, and a large dinner.

                Belgium has a plethora of local dishes and products. Examples include waterzooi from Ghent, couque
                biscuit from the town of Dinant, and tarte au riz from Verviers. While their local origins are
                acknowledged, most such dishes are enjoyed throughout Belgium.
