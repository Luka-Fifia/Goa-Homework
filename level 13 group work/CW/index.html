            <mark><strong>Super Mario</strong>[a] (also known as Super Mario Bros.[b] and Mario)[c] is a platform game
                series created by Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario.</mark> It is the central series of the greater
            Mario franchise.
            At least one
            Super Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. However, there have also
            been a number of Super Mario video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms.[1] There are more than
            20 games in the series. <br> <br>

            The Super Mario games are set primarily in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario as the main
            player character. He is usually joined by his brother, Luigi, and often other members of the Mario cast. As
            platform games, they involve the player character running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies in
            themed levels. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped Princess
            Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the
            Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements.
            These include a multitude of power-ups and items that give the character special powers such as
            fireball-throwing and size-changing.[2] <br> <br>

            The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video game genres and
            media such as film, television, printed media, and merchandise. More than 380 million copies of Super Mario
            games have been sold worldwide, making it the fifth-bestselling video game series, behind the larger Mario
            franchise, the puzzle series Tetris, the Pok√©mon video games, and Grand Theft Auto. <br> <br>

            The objective of the game is to progress through levels by defeating enemies, collecting items and solving
            puzzles without dying. Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both
            two and three-dimensional gameplay. In the 2D games, the player character (usually Mario) jumps on platforms
            and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D Super Mario
            game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next
            sequential level. Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced the overworld, a map of nonlinear levels that branches
            according to the player's choice.[4] Super Mario World introduced levels with multiple exits. <br> <br>
            3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: open world exploration based games and more linear 3D
            games with a predetermined path.[5] Levels in the open world games, 64, Sunshine and Odyssey, allow the
            player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360-degree movement. As the game progresses, more
            environments become accessible.[6] The linear 3D games, Galaxy, Galaxy 2, 3D Land and 3D World, feature more
            fixed camera angles and a predetermined path to a single goal. <br>

            The series often features the option to play as characters other than Mario, usually Luigi. Earlier games
            have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi
            is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in
            The Lost Levels, Galaxy 2, New Super Luigi U and the special worlds in 3D Land; these feature lower gravity
            and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Other playable characters
            include Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toads, Yoshi, Rosalina, and Nabbit, among others. Characters are
            sometimes differentiated by special abilities. <br> <br>

            Mushroom power-ups appear in almost every Super Mario game. The most iconic of these is the Super
            Mushroom.[7][8] The Super Mushroom increases the character's size, turning them into a "Super" variant, and
            allows them to break certain blocks. When hit by an enemy, the character reverts to their smaller size
            instead of losing a life.[7] When the character is in their "Super" form, most blocks that would contain a
            Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar
            in appearance to the Amanita muscaria, with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally
            red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview that beta tests of
            Super Mario Bros. proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink
            Mario.[9] Different variants of mushroom power-ups appear in the series. For example, Super Mario Bros.: The
            Lost Levels introduces the Poison Mushroom, which causes damage when collected; and New Super Mario Bros.
            introduces the Mini Mushroom, which shrinks the character to miniature size; and the Mega Mushroom, grows
            the character into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running
            through them.[10] <br> <br>

            Super Mario Bros. 3 introduces suits to the Super Mario series, many of which are based on animals or Mario
            enemies. The Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide the character with
            a tail that enables flight. In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets the character spontaneously change into an
            invincible statue for about five seconds. Super Mario Bros. 3 includes a Hammer Bros. suit, which allows
            Mario and Luigi to throw hammers as projectiles to defeat enemies at a distance. Other suits in later games
            in the series include the Frog Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit, Boomerang Suit, and Bee Suit. Super Mario Maker
            includes costume power-ups that depict many more characters (Super Mario Maker 2 includes only a Link
            power-up). <br> <br>

            The flower power-ups let the player character shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in Super Mario
            Bros., transforms the character into a Fire variant who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. Galaxy is
            the first 3D Super Mario game to have the Fire Flower. In Land and Maker 2, the Superball is a bouncing ball
            obtained from a Super Flower, which the character can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice
            Flower transforms the character into an Ice variant who can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to
            those of the Fire Flower; they freeze enemies in blocks of ice that can be used as platforms or thrown as
            projectiles, as seen in New Super Mario Bros. Wii and New Super Mario Bros. U.[11] In Galaxy, the Ice Flower
            turns Mario or Luigi into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface.
            Lastly, New Super Mario Bros. 2's Gold Flower lets Mario or Luigi turn bricks into coins and earn bonus
            coins for defeating enemies. <br> <br>

            Koopa Shells serve as a major projectile in the series, featuring since the original game. The character can
            throw them to defeat enemies, collect coins, and activate the functions of blocks. Power-ups are available
            for Yoshi to breathe fire in World, Yoshi's Island, and 64 DS, breathe freezing air and spit seeds in
            Yoshi's Island, spit out enemies in the World games, and spit juice in Sunshine. Other power-ups let the
            character throw bombs, boomerangs, and baseballs and shoot cannonballs. In Odyssey, Mario can possess
            characters, some of which can launch various projectiles. Flying shoot 'em up gameplay also appears in the
            series. Mario pilots the armed Sky Pop biplane and Marine Pop submarine in Land. The Koopa Clown Car,
            aircraft of Bowser and the Koopalings, can sometimes shoot fireballs in Maker. <br> <br>

            Apart from automated objects in levels that may transport the player character, certain ridable animals and
            vehicles have appeared that the player controls. Mario's dinosaur friend Yoshi has appeared as a mount to
            the player character in several Super Mario games since Super Mario World. In Yoshi's Island and 64 DS,
            instead of the player character merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis
            generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally
            wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in Super Mario Bros., but this wasn't possible due to the
            technical restraints of the system.[citation needed] Poochi is a dog featuring in Yoshi's Island who Yoshi
            can ride. Plesiosaurs Dorrie and Plessie can be ridden by the player characters in 64 and 3D World
            respectively,[12][13] with Plessie serving a larger role in Bowser's Fury.[14] <br> <br>

            Various vehicles that the player character can control have also appeared. These include a magic carpet in
            2, flying clouds in several 2D games, submarines in Land and Yoshi's Island, an airplane in Land, a
            helicopter, train, and mole tank in Yoshi's Island, cars in Yoshi's Island and Maker 2, and the Koopa Clown
            Car aircraft in the Maker games. <br>
