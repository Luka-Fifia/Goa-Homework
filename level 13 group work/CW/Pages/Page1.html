        <p>
            <strong>Super Mario Bros.</strong>, the first side-scrolling 2D platform game to feature Mario, was released
            for the Nintendo
            Entertainment System (NES) in 1985. It was derived through collaboration by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and
            Takashi Tezuka as a successor to the 1983 arcade game Mario Bros., which starred two characters: Mario, the
            titular character that first appeared in Donkey Kong as the original player character and its sequel where
            he was a final boss, and Luigi, who first appeared in Mario Bros.[24] Super Mario Bros. established many
            core Mario elements, such as Goombas, Koopa Troopas, Bowser, Peach, and its three power-ups: the Super
            Mushroom, increasing the character's size and providing an extra hit point, Fire Flower, allowing the
            character to throw fireballs as weapons, and Super Star, granting temporary invincibility. The "Super" in
            the title came from the integration of the Super Mushroom into the game.[25] The brothers Mario and Luigi
            must rescue Princess Toadstool/Peach from Bowser/King Koopa in the Mushroom Kingdom. The game consists of
            eight worlds of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the
            fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against Bowser (or one of his minions
            disguised as him).[26] Super Mario Bros. is one of the best-selling video games of all time.[27] <br> <br>

            Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (known as Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan) is the first sequel to the
            original Super Mario Bros. It uses the Super Mario Bros. engine, with additions such as weather, character
            movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same
            style of level progression as Super Mario Bros., with eight initial worlds of four levels each. At that
            time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Super Mario
            series to be known to players outside Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a
            steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the
            Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 could be eventually delivered to America.[28] The game later debuted outside
            Japan in 1993 as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels in the compilation game Super Mario All-Stars for the
            Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). <br> <br>

            In Super Mario Bros. 2 (known as Super Mario USA in Japan), Mario and his companions seek to defeat the evil
            frog Wart in the Subcon dreamland. Based on a discarded prototype,[29] the game was instead originally
            released as Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic in Japan, and was ultimately converted into a Mario game for the rest
            of the world as Super Mario Bros. 2, before being released in Japan as Super Mario USA as part of Super
            Mario All-Stars. One of the game's most defining aspects is the four player characters: not only Mario, but
            Luigi, Princess Peach and Toad are available for single-player gameplay, each with defined character
            movements: Luigi jumps higher, the Princess can hover in the air for a short amount of time, and Toad is the
            fastest. Characters here also can pluck items from the ground to throw at enemies. This is also the first
            Super Mario game to use a life meter, which allows the characters to be hit up to four times before
            dying.[28] <br> <br>

            Super Mario Bros. 3 is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6–10 levels and several bonus stages
            displayed as locations on a mapped overworld. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the
            player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be
            replayed. The penultimate boss stage in each world is a side-scrolling level atop an airship ("Doom Ship")
            with a fight against one of Bowser's seven Koopalings. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups,
            including flight as Raccoon Mario and Raccoon Luigi or the level-long P-Wing allowing flight through a whole
            level. Bowser is again the final boss. <br> <br>

            Super Mario Land is the first handheld Super Mario game apart from the Game & Watch conversion of Super
            Mario Bros., and was released for the Game Boy in 1989. Like the Super Mario Bros. games, it is a
            sidescrolling platformer. Mario sets out to save Princess Daisy from the spaceman Tatanga. Items include the
            Super Mushroom, Super Flower,[30] which allows Mario to shoot projectiles, Super Star, and hearts, which
            give Mario an extra life. The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds. Reaching the higher
            of two exits at each level's end activates a minigame where the player can try to get extra lives. <br> <br>

            Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System is the bestselling game of the system.
            Super Mario World was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and consists of nine worlds
            displayed via a world map. It is a direct successor to the Super Mario Bros. games, bearing the subtitle
            Super Mario Bros. 4 in Japan. Unlike Super Mario Bros. 3, however, where each world map is separate, the
            world map here covers the whole game. Some of the levels have hidden alternate exits leading to different
            areas. New abilities include a spin jump and the rideable Yoshi, who can eat enemies and either swallow or
            spit them out. Power-ups include the new Cape Feather, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape, and the
            P-balloon, which inflates the player character to allow him to float. <br> <br>

            Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins was released for the Game Boy in 1992. It introduces Mario's rival,
            Wario, who took over Mario's castle during the events of Super Mario Land and forces Mario to collect the
            six golden coins to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original Super
            Mario Bros., Super Mario Land 2 has more in common with Super Mario World, featuring a world map and the
            ability to move back to the left within levels. There are 32 levels, divided into several themed worlds that
            each have their own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game
            also introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for
            a limited time. Its story was continued in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, which retroactively became the
            first of a spin-off series, Wario Land. <br> <br>

            Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was released for the SNES in 1995. To reunite baby Mario with his
            brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek, the player controls Yoshi as the primary character through
            48 levels while carrying Baby Mario. Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while solving
            puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic. The game
            introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies. Yoshi's Island
            received "instant" and "universal acclaim", according to IGN and review aggregator Metacritic, and sold over
            four million copies. Yoshi's signature characteristics established in Yoshi's Island would carry throughout
            a series of cameos, spin-offs, and sequels. Sources have debated on whether Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's
            Island, where the player primarily controls a Yoshi carrying Baby Mario, should count as a Super Mario
            game,[31][32][33] with some sources considering it strictly a Yoshi game. Miyamoto responded affirmatively
            when asked if Yoshi's Island is a Super Mario game, with Tezuka later adding: <br>
