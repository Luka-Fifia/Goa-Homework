        <h2>1996-2005: Introduction of 3D and open-ended exploration</h2>

        <p>
            In the early 1990s, director and producer Shigeru Miyamoto had conceived a 3D Mario design during
            development of
            the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game Star Fox (1993). He considered using the Super FX chip
            to
            develop a SNES game, Super Mario FX, with gameplay based on "an entire world in miniature, like miniature
            trains".[35] He eventually reformulated the idea for the Nintendo 64, not for its substantially greater
            power,
            but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay.[36][37] Super Mario 64 was developed over
            approximately three years, with one year spent on the design concept and approximately two years on
            production.[35] Production began on September 7, 1994, and concluded on May 20, 1996.[38] Super Mario 64 is
            the
            first 3D and open world game in the series, and a launch game for the Nintendo 64 home console. Each level
            is an
            enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player
            collects Power Stars from the paintings in Peach's castle to unlock later courses and areas.[39] The
            Nintendo
            64's analog stick makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game
            introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first Super Mario
            series game to feature Charles Martinet's voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach
            from
            Bowser. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary
            powers:
            the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him
            to
            walk through obstacles. Super Mario 64 is considered seminal to 3D video games.[40][41][42] A remake of the
            game
            called Super Mario 64 DS was released for Nintendo DS in 2004 and 2005, adding Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario as
            playable characters, new abilities, new objectives, multiplayer, and minigames. <br> <br>

            Super Mario Sunshine is the second 3D Super Mario game. It was released in 2002 for the GameCube. In it,
            Mario
            and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario doppelg√§nger, going by the name of Shadow
            Mario,
            appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting
            accessory called F.L.U.D.D. Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor
            Super Mario 64, yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use
            of
            F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino
            Plaza.
            Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino
            Plaza
            by way of abilities and plot-related events.[43] Sunshine introduces the last of Bowser's eight children,
            Bowser
            Jr., as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears <br> <br>
