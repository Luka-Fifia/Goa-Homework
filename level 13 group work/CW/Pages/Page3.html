        <h2>2006-2016: 2D revival and path-focused 3D games</h2>
        <p>
            After no original 2D game releases in the series since 1995, New Super Mario Bros. was released on the
            Nintendo
            DS in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from Bowser Jr. The gameplay is 2D, but
            most
            of the characters and objects are 3D on two-dimensional backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect. The game
            uses
            an overworld map similar to those of Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic
            power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and
            Mini
            Mushroom. <br> <br>

            Miyamoto explained that when he was developing Super Mario 64 with Yoshiaki Koizumi, they realized that the
            title would be more directed towards the "core gamer", rather than the casual, "pick-up-and-go" gamer.[44]
            After
            Sunshine, their focus shifted to more accessible, casual games, leading them to develop Super Mario Galaxy
            with
            more progression-oriented paths. Galaxy was launched in 2007 for the Wii. It is set in outer space, where
            Mario
            or Luigi travel between "galaxies" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies.
            It
            introduced motion controls to the series. Each galaxy contains a number of planets and other space objects
            for
            the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own gravitational force,
            which
            lets the character circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The
            character is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though
            the
            main gameplay and physics are in 3D, there are several points in the game where the character's movements
            are
            restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics.

            New Super Mario Bros. Wii (2009) features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice
            Flower, and the Penguin Suit. All characters can ride Yoshi. <br> <br>

            Super Mario Galaxy 2, released on May 23, 2010, was initially developed as an expansion pack to Galaxy, but
            was
            eventually developed into its own game. It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its
            items
            and power-ups besides the Ice Flower and Red Star. New power-ups include the Cloud Flower, which allows
            Mario or
            Luigi to create platforms in mid-air and the Rock Mushroom, which turns the character into a rolling
            boulder.
            The character can also ride Yoshi. The game was released to widespread critical acclaim, getting better
            reviews
            than its predecessor. <br> <br>

            Super Mario 3D Land was released for the Nintendo 3DS in November and December 2011. It was the first
            attempt to
            translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, and simplify the control scheme of the 3D
            games
            through including more linear levels. It is the first original 3D Super Mario game on a handheld console,
            since
            all previous handheld games were either 2D or a port of a previous game. It also brought back several older
            gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in Super Mario Bros. 3.

            New Super Mario Bros. 2 was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or
            Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal to
            collect
            one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold
            Flower,
            a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.[45][46]

            New Super Mario Bros. U, the Wii U follow-up to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, was released in November 2012. It
            introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the characters glide through the air, and asymmetric
            gameplay
            that allows the player holding the GamePad to influence the environment. In June 2013, New Super Luigi U was
            released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter, but more difficult levels,
            starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently, it was released as a standalone
            retail game on August 25 in North America.[47] The Nintendo Switch port New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe
            includes
            both the main game and New Super Luigi U, and new playable characters Nabbit and Toadette.[48]

            Super Mario 3D World, the sequel to 3D Land, was released for the Wii U on November 22, 2013, in North
            America,
            and used the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor.[49] Co-operative multiplayer is available for up to
            four players. The game introduced the ability to turn the characters into cats able to attack and scale
            walls to
            reach new areas, and to create clones of the characters. Like Super Mario Bros. 2, it features Princess
            Peach
            and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy is also
            unlocked later in the game. Miyamoto said that "even though that's a 3D game, it's a little more accessible
            to
            everybody." <br> <br>


            Super Mario Maker series logo
            Super Mario Maker is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015[50] which allows players to
            create
            their own levels based on the gameplay and style of Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario
            World,
            and New Super Mario Bros. U, as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several
            gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in
            new
            ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS, was released in December
            2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing. Super Mario Maker 2 is a new
            version of Super Mario Maker with many new items, themes, and enemies, a world-builder, as well as online
            multiplayer. The game was released on June 28, 2019, for the Nintendo Switch. <br> <br>

            Super Mario Run is a side-scrolling and auto-scrolling video game released in December 2016 on the iOS
            platform,
            then in March 2017 on Android. It is the first official Super Mario game developed for mobile devices. As
            such,
            it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand. In this game, the character
            runs
            automatically, with the player controlling the jumping action to avoid hazards. This is achieved by touching
            the
            tactile screens these devices are built with. The longer the player touches the jump button, the higher the
            character jumps. This game also includes a "Toad Rally" mode, similar to the "VS Boo" mode of Super Mario
            Bros
            Deluxe, in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this
            mode
            earns the player access to in-game money to spend on customizing the Mushroom Kingdom map, using mechanics
            similar to FarmVille. This is the first Super Mario game that Princess Daisy is playable in and the first to
            feature a music track with vocals <br> <br>
