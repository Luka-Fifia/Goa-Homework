            <h1>Jackie Chan</h1>
            <p>
                Fang Shilong[a] SBS MBE PMW[3] (born Chan Kong-sang[b]; 7 April 1954), known professionally as Jackie
                Chan,[c] is a Hong Kong actor, director, writer, producer, martial artist, and stuntman known for his
                slapstick - acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs
                himself. Before entering the film industry, he was one of the Seven Little Fortunes from the China Drama
                Academy at the Peking Opera School, where he studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting. In a film
                career spanning more than sixty years, he has appeared in over 150 domestic and international movies.
                Chan is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential martial artists in the history of
                cinema. <br> <br>

                After appearing in many Hong Kong films as a stuntman, Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 kung
                fu action comedy film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. He then starred in similar kung fu action comedy
                films such as 1978's Drunken Master and 1980's The Young Master. In 1979, he made his directorial debut
                with The Fearless Hyena, which was a box office success. Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the "Three
                Dragons" along with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together.[6]
                1983's Project A saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and established Chan's
                signature style of elaborate, dangerous stunts combined with martial arts and slapstick humor, a style
                he further developed in a more modern setting with 1984's Wheels on Meals and 1985's Police Story.
                Rumble in the Bronx (1995), which had a successful worldwide theatrical run, brought Chan into the North
                American mainstream.[7][8] He gained international fame for portraying Chief Inspector Lee in the
                American buddy cop action comedy film Rush Hour (1998), a role he reprised in two sequels. <br> <br>

                Chan continued to work both in Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema, appearing in the well-received Shanghai
                Noon (2000) and Shanghai Knights (2003) in the Shanghai film series, New Police Story (2004), Rob-B-Hood
                (2006), Little Big Soldier (2010), and Shaolin (2011), among others. The US-China co-production The
                Forbidden Kingdom (2008) marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jet Li. He has
                played martial arts mentor Mr. Han in two Karate Kid films, the 2010 remake The Karate Kid and the
                upcoming Karate Kid: Legends (2025). For CZ12 (2012), he earned two Guinness World Records for "Most
                Stunts Performed by a Living Actor" and "Most Credits in One Movie". His against type performances
                include Shinjuku Incident (2009) and The Foreigner (2017).[9][10] His voice acting work includes all
                three Chinese versions of Mulan (1998), the first three films in the Kung Fu Panda franchise
                (2008-2016), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023). The animated television series
                Jackie Chan Adventures (2000-2005) focuses on a fictionalized version of Chan. <br> <br>

                Chan is one of the most recognizable and influential film personalities in the world, with a widespread
                global following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. He has received fame stars on the Hong
                Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame,[11][12] as well as an honorary Academy Award for
                his "extraordinary achievements" in film. Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons,
                films, and video games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star,
                having released a number of music albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has
                starred. He is also a globally known philanthropist and has been named one of the top 10 most charitable
                celebrities by Forbes magazine.[13][14] In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was perhaps
                the "most recognized film star in the world."[15] In 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $350
                million, and as of 2016, he was the second-highest-paid actor in the world. <br> <br>

            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
                Chan was born on 7 April 1954 in British Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang[1][2] to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan,
                political refugees from the Chinese Civil War. In circa 1937, Chan's father, originally named Fang
                Daolong, briefly worked as a secret agent for Lieutenant General Dai Li, the chief spy in
                Kuomintang-ruled China.[18] For fear of being arrested by the communist government, Chan's father fled
                to British Hong Kong in the 1940s and changed his surname from Fang to Chan. Chan was his wife Chan
                Lee-lee's surname. Chan discovered his father's identity and changed his Chinese name to Fang Shilong
                (房仕龍) in the late 1990s, the name he would have been named according to his kin's genealogy book. Chan's
                ancestral roots are located in Wuhu, Anhui.[19][20][21][22]

                Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the French consul's residence in the Victoria Peak,
                British Hong Kong, as his father worked as a cook there.[23] Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on
                Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.
                In 1960, his father emigrated to Canberra, Australia to work as the head cook for the American embassy,
                and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen.[23][24]
                Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics.[25] He eventually
                became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students,
                gaining the stage name Yuen Lo (元樓) in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group
                members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, and the three of them later became known as the Three Brothers or
                Three Dragons.[26] After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to
                train in hapkido under the grand master Jin Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a black belt.[27] As a
                martial artist, Chan is also skilled in multiple forms of Kung-fu.[28] He is also known to have trained
                in other martial art forms such as Karate, Judo, Taekwondo, and Jeet Kun Do. <br> <br>

                Chan joined his parents in Canberra, Australia in 1971, where he briefly attended Dickson College and
                worked as a construction worker.[30] A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, thus earning
                Chan the nickname of "Little Jack", later shortened to "Jackie", which has stuck with him ever since.

            <h2>Personal life</h2>
            <p>
                In 1982, Chan married Joan Lin, a Taiwanese actress. Their son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan, was born
                that same year. <br> <br>

                Chan had an extra-marital affair with Elaine Ng Yi-Lei and has a daughter Etta Ng Chok Lam by her, born
                on 18 January 1999. It turned into a scandal within the media. Although he reportedly gave Elaine
                HK$70,000 each month for her living expenses and HK$600,000 when she moved to Shanghai, the transactions
                were later claimed to be nonexistent by her lawyer. <br> <br>

                Despite regretting the results of the affair, Chan said he had "only committed a fault that many men in
                the world commit". During the incident, Elaine stated she would take care of her daughter
                without Chan. <br> <br>

                Chan speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and American Sign Language and also speaks some German,
                Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai. Chan is an avid football fan and supports the Hong Kong
                national football team, the England national football team, and Manchester City. <br> <br>

                He is a fan of the Italian duo Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, from whom he was inspired for his movies. <br> <br>
