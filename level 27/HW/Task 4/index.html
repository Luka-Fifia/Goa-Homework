            <h1>Jet Li</h1>
            <p>
                Li Lianjie (courtesy name Yangzhong; born 26 April 1963),[2] better known by his stage name Jet Li, is a
                Chinese-born Singaporean martial artist, actor, and philanthropist. After three years of training with
                acclaimed wushu teacher Wu Bin, Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team at age
                11. Between 1974 and 1979, he won the title of Men's All-Around National Wushu Champion five times.[3]
                After retiring from competitive wushu at age 18, he went on to win great acclaim as an actor, making his
                debut with the Chinese-Hong Kong martial arts film Shaolin Temple (1982), which instantly catapulted him
                to stardom in East Asia. <br> <br>

                Though continued success followed after two sequels in 1984 and 1986, Li had a major breakthrough across
                Asia with the Once Upon a Time in China film series (1991–1993), in which he portrayed Chinese folk hero
                Wong Fei-hung. He continued to appear in Hong Kong films set in old China, such as Swordsman II (1992),
                Tai Chi Master, Fong Sai-yuk, Fong Sai-yuk II, Kung Fu Cult Master, Last Hero in China (all 1993), and
                The New Legend of Shaolin (1994). He starred in his directorial debut film Born to Defence (1986), which
                saw Li, for the first time, playing a character in a period setting.[5] In the 1990s, he appeared in
                several contemporary action films which fused guns and kung fu, most notably High Risk (1995), Black
                Mask (1996), and Hitman (1998).[6] He portrayed Chen Zhen in the critically acclaimed film Fist of
                Legend (1994). His movie career in China is credited with reviving wushu in Hong Kong martial arts films
                during the 1990s,[3] and revitalising the Shaolin Temple.[7] Li is also noted for his contribution to
                making new wuxia films popular internationally during his career. <br> <br>

                His first role in a non-Chinese film was as a villain in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998), and his first leading
                role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in Romeo Must Die (2000). He has gone on to star in many
                international action films, including in French cinema with the Luc Besson-produced films Kiss of the
                Dragon (2001) and Unleashed (2005). He co-starred in The One (2001) and War (2007) with Jason Statham,
                the first three of The Expendables films with Sylvester Stallone, and portrayed the title character
                villain in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008). The US-China co-production The Forbidden
                Kingdom (2008) marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jackie Chan. He continued to
                be active in Hong Kong cinema, appearing in the critically acclaimed film Hero (2002), Fearless (2006),
                which marked his final wushu martial arts film, and The Warlords (2007). For the latter, he became the
                highest paid actor in a Chinese-language movie, previously holding the record for his part in Hero. <br>
                <br>

                With a film career spanning more than forty years, Li is regarded as one of the most iconic Chinese film
                stars and one of the most renowned martial arts stars of his generation.[9][10] In 2004, he topped
                Forbes list of China's richest stars.[11] As a philanthropist, he founded the One Foundation in 2007,
                which was registered in 2011 as the first private charitable fundraising organization in
                China.[12][13][14][15] He also founded Taiji Zen along with Jack Ma, an online health and wellness
                program providing instruction in meditation and tai chi.[16][17] Li was named by Time as one of the 100
                Most Influential People in 2010. <br> <br>

            <h2>Early life and martial arts career</h2>
            <p>
                Li was born in Beijing, China, and was the youngest of two boys and two girls. His ancestral home is in
                Shenyang, China. When he was two years old, his father died and his family then lived in
                poverty. <br> <br>

                Li was eight when his talent for Wushu was noticed as he practiced at a school summer course.[21] He
                then attended a non-sparring wushu event, followed by joining the Beijing Wushu Team which did a martial
                art display at the All China Games. Renowned coaches Li Junfeng and Wu Bin[22] made extra efforts to
                help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li's family in order to boost Li's protein
                intake.<br> <br>

                A very young Li competed against adults[23] and was the national all-around champion from 1975 to
                1979.<br> <br>

                My winning first place caused quite a sensation because I was so young. I was 12 years old, and the
                other two medalists were in their mid- to late twenties. During the awards ceremony, as I stood on the
                top step of the podium, I was still shorter than the 2nd and 3rd place medalists. It must have been
                quite a sight.

                — Jet Li China's Internet Celebrity[25]
                In 1974, Li was part of a delegation of forty-three martial arts practitioners who traveled to the
                United States as part of China's people's diplomacy.[26] The group performed for American audiences in
                Hawaii, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C.<br> <br>

                According to Li, once, as a child, when the Chinese National Wushu Team went to perform for President
                Richard Nixon in the United States, he was asked by Nixon to be his personal bodyguard. Li replied, "I
                don't want to protect any individual. When I grow up, I want to defend my one billion Chinese
                countrymen!"<br> <br>

                Li is a master of several styles of wushu, especially changquan and fanziquan. He has also studied other
                arts including baguazhang, tai chi, xingyiquan, drunken boxing, Eagle Claw, and Praying Mantis. He did
                not learn Nanquan ("Southern Boxing"), because his training focused only in the Northern Shaolin Styles.
                He has also mastered wushu's main weapons, such as Sanjiegun (Three Section Staff), Gun, Dao
                (Broadsword), Jian (Straight Sword).<br> <br>

                Li retired from competitive wushu when he was only 18 due to a knee injury,[29] but became an assistant
                coach of the Beijing Wushu team for a few years. Li's martial arts prowess would eventually contribute
                to his domestic and international fame. <br> <br>

            <h2>Personal life</h2>
            <p>
                In 1998, Li converted to Tibetan Buddhism when he was promoting Lethal Weapon 4 in Taiwan.[60][61] His
                master is Lho Kunsang. <br> <br>

                In 1987, Li married Beijing Wushu Team member and Kids From Shaolin co-star Huang Qiuyan,[63] with whom
                he has two daughters, Si and Taimi.[64] He met actress Nina Li Chi during the filming of Dragon Fight
                (1989) and divorced Huang in 1990. In 1999, Li married Nina at his villa in Arcadia, California,[65]
                which he owned from 1998 to 2004.[66] The couple have two daughters, Jane (born 2000) and Jada (born
                2002).<br> <br>

                Li was in the Maldives when a tsunami hit during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Although
                it was widely reported at the time that he had died during the disaster,[68] Li only suffered a minor
                foot injury caused by a piece of floating furniture when he was guiding Jane and the nanny—who was
                holding Jada—to safety of higher ground amid dangerously rising ocean water. They were by the pool and
                slightly above the beach when the wave came ashore, barely escaping to the upper floors of a hotel
                building.<br> <br>

                Li was appointed by the Chinese Wushu Association as the "Image Ambassador of Wushu" (or IWUF
                ambassador) at the 2007 World Wushu Championships in Beijing. <br> <br>

                In April 2009, Li renounced his US citizenship,[70] which he obtained in 1997.[71][72] He was thought to
                have obtained Singaporean citizenship, although Singaporean authorities did not initially provide any
                confirmation of this.[73] In July, the One Foundation's executive chairperson announced that Li had
                indeed become a Singaporean citizen. Li was said to have chosen Singapore for his two younger daughters'
                education.[74] According to The Korea Herald in 2011, Li did not say whether he had renounced his US and
                Chinese nationalities, but Singapore law forbids citizens from holding dual passports.[75] In 2009, he
                launched his own fitness program, Wuji[76]—which consists of elements of martial arts, yoga and
                pilates—and Adidas launched a special clothing line for it that bears the initials of "JL".<br> <br>

                In 2013, Li revealed that he suffers from hyperthyroidism and had been dealing with the issue for the
                past three years.[79] In 2016, Li stated that he was accepting fewer film offers due to his charity work
                rather than his illness, from which he had recovered.<br> <br>

                Li likes to play badminton and table tennis, ride his bicycle, read and meditate in his free time. He
                collects rare Tibetan beads. Li has stated that he is never bored in his free time.<br> <br>
