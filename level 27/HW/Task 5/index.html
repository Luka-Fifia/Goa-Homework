            <h1>Sylvester Stallone</h1>
            <p>
                Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone (/stəˈloʊn/; born July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker. He has
                received numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Critics' Choice Award, as well as
                nominations for three Academy Awards and two BAFTA Awards. Stallone is one of only two actors in history
                (alongside Harrison Ford) to have starred in a box-office No. 1 film across six consecutive
                decades. <br> <br>

                Struggling as an actor for a number of years upon moving to New York City in 1969, Stallone found
                gradual work in films such as The Lords of Flatbush (1974). He achieved his greatest critical and
                commercial success starting in 1976 with his iconic role as boxer Rocky Balboa in the first film of the
                successful Rocky franchise, which he also wrote.[4] In 1977, he became the third actor in history to be
                nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He portrayed the
                PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo in First Blood (1982), a role he would play across five Rambo films
                (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s to the late 1990s, Stallone would go on to become one of Hollywood's
                highest-paid actors acting in action films such as Cobra (1986), Tango and Cash (1989), Cliffhanger
                (1993), Demolition Man (1993), and The Specialist (1994). He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of
                Fame in 1984. <br> <br>

                Stallone continued his established roles in Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rambo (2008) before launching The
                Expendables film franchise (2010–present), in which he starred as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he
                starred in the successful film Escape Plan and appeared in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to Rocky
                again with Creed, in which a retired Rocky mentors former rival Apollo Creed's son Donnie Creed. The
                film brought Stallone widespread praise and his first Golden Globe Award, as well as a third Academy
                Award nomination, having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior. Since 2022, he has
                starred in the Paramount+ crime series Tulsa King. <br> <br>

            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <p>
                Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone[5][6][7] was born in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City's
                Manhattan borough[8] on July 6, 1946,[9] the elder son of women's professional wrestling promoter
                Jacqueline "Jackie" Stallone (née Labofish; 1921–2020) and hairdresser Francesco "Frank" Stallone Sr.
                (1919–2011).[10] His mother was an American from Washington, D.C., with Breton French[11] and Ukrainian
                Jewish ancestry,[12][13][14] while his father was an Italian immigrant from Gioia del Colle[10] who
                moved to the U.S. in the 1930s.[15][16] His younger brother is actor and musician Frank Stallone.[10]
                Many biographies of Stallone indicate that his birth name is "Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone" and
                his mother explained in an interview that she originally named him "Tyrone" because she admired the
                actor Tyrone Power, but Stallone's father changed it to "Sylvester". His nickname as a child was "Binky"
                but he chose to go by the nickname of Mike/Michael after schoolmates began calling him
                "Stinky".[5][6][7] His middle name "Gardenzio" is an alteration of the Italian given name "Gaudenzio"
                and he usually shortened it to "Enzio". <br> <br>

                Complications during Stallone's birth forced his mother's obstetricians to use two pairs of forceps
                while delivering him, accidentally severing a nerve in the process.[17][18] This caused paralysis of the
                lower left side of his face (including parts of his lip, tongue, and chin) which gave him his signature
                snarling look and slurred speech.[18][19] As a result, he was bullied in his childhood, with which he
                coped by getting into bodybuilding and acting.[20] A guidance counselor once told Stallone's mother:
                "Your son is suited to run a sorting machine or to be an assistant electrician, primarily in the area of
                elevator operations"; nevertheless, Sylvester aspired to be an actor and a screenwriter.” <br> <br>

                Stallone spent part of his infancy in foster and boarding care, rejoining and moving back with his
                family to Maryland when he was five. In the early 1950s, his father moved the family to his mother's
                native Washington, D.C. to open a beauty school. In 1954, his mother opened a women's gym called
                Barbella's.[22][23] He initially stayed with his father following his parents' divorce when he was 11,
                but joined his remarried mother in Philadelphia when he was 15.<br> <br>

                At one point, Stallone's teachers voted him "Most Likely To End Up In The Electric Chair";[25]
                nevertheless, Stallone attended Notre Dame Academy and Abraham Lincoln High School in Philadelphia,[26]
                and Charlotte Hall Military Academy in Charlotte Hall, Maryland, prior to attending Miami Dade
                College.[27] He spent two years, from September 1965 to June 1967, at the American College of
                Switzerland. He returned to the United States to study as a drama major at the University of Miami, from
                1967 to 1969, but did not graduate.[28] Decades later, after Stallone's request that his acting and life
                experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining needed college credits to graduate, he was granted
                a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) degree by the University of Miami in 1998. <br> <br>

            <h2>Multiple tasks in media</h2>
            <p>
                In 1977, for the first Rocky, Stallone became the third man in history to receive the two nominations
                for best actor and best screenplay, after Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles.[129] Like the aforementioned
                he wrote and took on the leading role in the film. Stallone is known for his recurring roles as Rocky
                Balboa, John Rambo, and Barney Ross. Stallone wrote and starred in all of six Rocky films, while taking
                on the task of directing in four of the sequels. Stallone starred and co-wrote the five films of the
                Rambo franchise, and the fourth one he also directed. Stallone wrote, directed and took the lead role in
                the first installment of The Expendables films. Stallone directed, starred and wrote in Paradise Alley.
                John Travolta starred in Staying Alive, a sequel of Saturday Night Fever, which Stallone wrote and
                directed. Stallone wrote and starred in Cobra, and Driven. Stallone co-wrote and starred in F.I.S.T.,
                Rhinestone, Over the Top, Cliffhanger, and Creed II. <br> <br>

                Asked in February 2008 which of the icons (Rocky or Rambo) he would rather be remembered for, Stallone
                said "it's a tough one, but Rocky is my first baby, so Rocky."[130] He also stated that Rocky could be
                interpreted as the "conscious" and Rambo as the "unconscious" of the same character. <br> <br>

                Stallone has occasionally sung in his films. He sang "Too Close to Paradise" for Paradise Alley (1978),
                with the music provided by Bill Conti (who also collaborated with Stallone in prior years, having
                recorded the famous "Gonna Fly Now" theme for his Academy Award-nominated film, Rocky (1976) which was a
                U.S. No. 1 hit).[132] In Rocky III (1982), Stallone (as Rocky Balboa) sang "Take Me Back" to his
                on-screen wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), as they lay in bed. The song was first performed by singer and
                younger brother, Frank, who had a small role in the original Rocky. For Rhinestone (1984), Stallone sang
                such songs as "Drinkenstein" as well as duets with his co-star, and actual country music star, Dolly
                Parton.[133] He also performed two songs when he guest-starred on The Muppet Show in the 1980s, at the
                height of his career.[134] The last time Stallone sang in a film was in Grudge Match (2013) when he and
                Robert De Niro performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" together. <br> <br>
