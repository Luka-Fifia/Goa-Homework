            <h2>Life of Pi</h2>
            <p>
                Life of Pi is a Canadian philosophical novel by Yann Martel published in 2001. The protagonist is
                Piscine Molitor "Pi" Patel, an Indian boy from Pondicherry, India, who explores issues of spirituality
                and metaphysics from an early age. After a shipwreck, he survives 227 days while stranded on a lifeboat
                in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger, raising questions about the nature of reality and how it is
                perceived and told.
                The novel has sold more than ten million copies worldwide.[1] It was rejected by at least five London
                publishing houses[2] before being accepted by Knopf Canada, which published it in September 2001. Martel
                won the Man Booker Prize the following year.[3][4][5] It was also chosen for CBC Radio's Canada Reads
                2003, where it was championed by author Nancy Lee.[6]

                The French translation L'Histoire de Pi was chosen in the French CBC version of the contest Le Combat
                des livres, where it was championed by Louise Forestier.[7] The novel won the 2003 Boeke Prize, a South
                African novel award. In 2004, it won the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature in Best Adult
                Fiction for years 2001–2003.[8] In 2012 it was adapted into a feature film directed by Ang Lee with a
                screenplay by David Magee.

                In 2022, the novel was included on the "Big Jubilee Read" list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors,
                selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Martel said in a 2002 interview with PBS that he was "looking for a story… that would direct my
                life".[12] He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and he found that writing the
                novel met this need.
