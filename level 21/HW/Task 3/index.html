            <h2>Flying fish</h2>
            <p>
                The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order Beloniformes, known colloquially as
                flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven genera. While they cannot fly in the
                same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their
                long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface. The main reason
                for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators,[3][4][5] which include
                swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others,[6] though their periods of flight expose them to
                attack by avian predators such as frigate birds.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
                The term Exocoetidae is both the scientific name and the general name in Latin for a flying fish. The
                suffix -idae, common for indicating a family, follows the root of the Latin word exocoetus, a
                transliteration of the Ancient Greek name ἐξώκοιτος. This means literally 'sleeping outside', from ἔξω,
                'outside', and κοῖτος, 'bed', 'resting place', with the verb root κει-, 'to lie down' (not
                'untruth'),[7] so named as flying fish were believed to leave the water to sleep ashore,[8] or due to
                flying fish flying and thus stranding themselves in boats.

            <h2>Flight measurements</h2>
            <p>
                In May 2008, a Japanese television crew (NHK) filmed a flying fish (dubbed "Icarfish") off the coast of
                Yakushima Island, Japan. The fish spent 45 seconds in flight.[17] The previous record was 42
                seconds. <br> <br>

                The flights of flying fish are typically around 50 m (160 ft),[18] though they can use updrafts at the
                leading edge of waves to cover distances up to 400 m (1,300 ft).[18][19] They can travel at speeds of
                more than 70 km/h (43 mph).[15] Maximum altitude is 6 m (20 ft) above the surface of the sea.[16] Flying
                fish often accidentally land on the decks of smaller vessels
