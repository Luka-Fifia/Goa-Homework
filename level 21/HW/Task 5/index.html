            <h2>J. R. R. Tolkien</h2>
            <p>
                John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/,[a] 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an
                English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of
                the Rings. <br> <br>

                From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of
                Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become
                the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these
                positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member
                of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the
                British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. <br> <br>

                After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive
                notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The
                Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and
                literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955,
                Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings. <br> <br>

                While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the tremendous success of The
                Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately
                precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors. As a result, he has been popularly
                identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature and is widely regarded as one of the most
                influential authors of all time.

                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Tolkien was English, and thought of himself as such.[3][T 1] His immediate paternal ancestors were
                    middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The
                    Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near Königsberg, which had been
                    founded during the medieval German eastward expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor,
                    Michel Tolkien, was born around 1620. <br> <br>

                    Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663–1746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.[4] His son,
                    Christian Tolkien (1706–1791), moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel
                    Gottlieb Tolkien (1747–1813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752–1819) emigrated
                    to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R.
                    R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. <br> <br>

                    In 1792, John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in
                    London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb
                    obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen.
                    Other German relatives joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or
                    similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern
                    Germany, but most of them are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end
                    of World War II. <br> <br>

                    According to Ryszard Derdziński, the surname Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and probably means
                    "son/descendant of Tolk".[5][4] Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word
                    tollkühn, meaning "foolhardy",[7] and jokingly inserted himself as a "cameo" into The Notion Club
                    Papers under the literally translated name Rashbold.[8] However, Derdziński has demonstrated this to
                    be a false etymology. While J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of his family's German origin, his knowledge
                    of the family's history was limited because he was "early isolated from the family of his
                    prematurely deceased father". <br> <br>

                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>
                    John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later
                    annexed by the British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa), to Arthur
                    Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904).
                    The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British
                    bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien,
                    who was born on 17 February 1894. <br> <br>

                    As a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have
                    been later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event as an adult. In
                    an earlier incident from Tolkien's infancy, a young family servant took the baby to his homestead,
                    returning him the next morning. <br> <br>

                    When he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a
                    lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could
                    join them.[11] This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her
                    parents in Kings Heath,[12] Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall
                    Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham.[13] He enjoyed exploring
                    Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire
                    scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and
                    Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his
                    fiction. <br> <br>

                    Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen
                    pupil.[15] She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and
                    feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were
                    those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early. <br> <br>

                    Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed
                    him to read many books. He disliked Treasure Island and "The Pied Piper" and thought Alice's
                    Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was "amusing but disturbing". He liked stories about "Red
                    Indians" (the term then used for Native Americans in adventure stories[17]) and works of fantasy by
                    George MacDonald.[18] In addition, the "Fairy Books" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to
                    him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.
