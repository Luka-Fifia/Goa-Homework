                Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae (/sɪˈjuːrɪdeɪ, -diː/), a family that includes small or
                medium-sized rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels (including chipmunks
                and prairie dogs, among others), and flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas,
                Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.[1] The earliest known fossilized
                squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most
                closely related to the mountain beaver and dormice.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
                The word squirrel, first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel which is from the Old
                French escurel, the reflex of a Latin word sciurus, which was taken from the Ancient Greek word σκίουρος
                (skiouros; from σκία-ουρος) 'shadow-tailed', referring to the long bushy tail which many of its members
                have.[3][4] Sciurus is also the name of one of its genuses. <br> <br>

                The native Old English word for the squirrel, ācweorna, only survived into Middle English (as aquerne)
                before being replaced.[5] The Old English word is of Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still
                used in other Germanic languages, including the German Eichhörnchen (diminutive of Eichhorn, which is
                not as frequently used); the Norwegian ikorn/ekorn; the Dutch eekhoorn; the Swedish ekorre and the
                Danish egern.

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            <p>
                Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel and least pygmy squirrel at 10–14 cm (3.9–5.5 in) in total length and just 12–26 g (0.42–0.92 oz) in weight,[8][9] to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at up to 1.27 m (4 ft 2 in) in total length,[10] and several marmot species, which can weigh 8 kg (18 lb) or more.[11][12] Squirrels typically have slender bodies with very long very bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, though much thicker in some species than others. The coat color of squirrels is highly variable between—and often even within—species.
