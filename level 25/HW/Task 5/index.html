                    Well, Just You Wait![1] (Russian: Ну, погоди!, romanized: Nu, pogodi!, Russian pronunciation:
                    [nʊpəgɐˈdʲi]) Also known as I'll get you![2] in official translations, is a Soviet, later Russian,
                    series of animated short films produced by Soyuzmultfilm. In the 2014 all-Russian poll, Well, Just
                    You Wait! won by a wide margin as people's favourite cartoon/animated series of all time.[3]

                    The series follows the comical adventures of Wolf (Волк), trying to catch – and presumably eat –
                    Hare (Заяц). It features additional characters that usually either help the hare or interfere with
                    the Wolf's plans. The original film language is Russian, but very little speech is used, usually
                    interjections or at most several sentences per episode. The series' most common line is the
                    eponymous "Nu, pogodi!", yelled by the wolf when his plans fail. It also includes many grunts,
                    laughs, and songs.

                    The Hare, commonly transliterated into English as Zayats (Russian: Заяц), is portrayed as a
                    supposedly positive hero. He is less developed than the Wolf, and most of his actions are simply
                    reactions to the Wolf's schemes. In later episodes, the role of the Hare becomes more active and
                    developed, and he even manages to save the Wolf on several occasions. The Hare is portrayed as a
                    percussionist in a number of episodes. The character was originally voiced by Klara Rumyanova.

                    The Hare is often mistaken as a female due to his appearance and voice; however, the Hare's gender
                    is never explicitly indicated. The Russian word for hare, заяц (zayats), is of masculine gender. The
                    female equivalent is зайчиха (zaychikha).

                    The Hare is almost always seen wearing the same green T-shirt and dark green shorts, unlike the
                    Wolf's ever-varying wardrobe. There are rare exceptions, however: in the prologue of Episode 8, he
                    appears in an ice-skating outfit, and later on in the same episode, he is dressed with intentional
                    absurdity as the grandfatherly Ded Moroz (Father Frost), the silliness of which is only heightened
                    by the Wolf then appearing as his granddaughter, Snegurochka, also known as the Snow Maiden.

                    The Wolf, commonly transliterated into English as Volk (Russian: Волк), is initially portrayed as a
                    hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws, and is a smoker. His appearance
                    was inspired by a person the director Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin saw on the street, specifically a man
                    with long hair, a protruding belly, and a thick cigarette between his lips.[4] The character was
                    originally voiced by Anatoli Papanov.

                    His most common line throughout the series when things are not going as he expected is "Nu, pogodi!"
                    At the end of an episode (and at the end of the pre-title introduction), the Wolf usually exclaims
                    the series' titular phrase, "Nu, Zayats... Nu, pogodi!" which translates as "Well, Hare... Well,
                    just you wait!".

                    In spite of his rough appearance, many of the Wolf's attempts to catch the Hare are often
                    characterized by unexpected abilities on his part (including figure skating, ballet, gymnastics, and
                    waltzing) for humorous contrast. He can also play the guitar very well and rides a powerful rocker
                    motorbike. In the first episode, while climbing a high building to catch the Hare, the Wolf whistles
                    the popular mountaineer song, "A Song About a Friend" (a signature song of Vladimir Vysotsky). In
                    spite of these talents, most of the Wolf's schemes eventually fail or turn against him.

                    During the late Soviet and post-Soviet era, however, the Wolf gradually became more buffoonish than
                    menacing. In the last episode (#20), for example, the Wolf is seen chewing a lollipop instead of
                    smoking and his drawing style is reminiscent of new Russian cartoons (Russian: Новые русские
                    мультфильмы) rather than the old Soviet slapstick genre. The Wolf became increasingly timid or even
                    outright cowardly during this time period, contrasting sharply with his initially "macho" persona
                    and actor's voice.

                    The Wolf's most characteristic piece of clothing is his bell-bottoms which can ambiguously be either
                    part of the naval uniform or the 1970s fashion. He is most often seen in a pink shirt with a yellow
                    necktie, but occasionally (Episode 7) appears in a naval undershirt (telnyashka) and in Episode 8,
                    he appears in drag, impersonating the Snegurochka. In Episode 11 he wears a jacket in the beginning,
                    but soon removes it when chasing the Hare. Not infrequently, he loses most of his clothes during the
                    chase, going on in his chintz underpants only (those are a realistic depiction of Soviet-style
                    underwear), though in episode 6, he retains only his shirt and pulls it down to cover up his "naked"
                    hindquarters. Humorously, all of his clothing below the waist has a special opening for his tail.

                    In Episodes 1–16 the Wolf's hairstyle is basically unchanged, though in Episode 14 his hair gets
                    briefly done in a style not unlike Elvis Presley's. In Episode 17 he wears a ponytail, and in
                    Episode 18 his forelock is cropped and the mullet is tied into a ponytail. However, in the three
                    final episodes he resumes his earlier hairstyle of episodes 1–16.
