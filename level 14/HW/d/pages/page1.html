        <h1>Second generation (1972-1973)</h1>

            The KPGC10's successor, the KPGC110, was introduced in 1973 after its introduction at the 1972 Tokyo Motor
            Show.
            Powered by a 1,989 cc S20 inline-6 engine, the second generation of the GT-R delivered power to the rear
            wheels
            through a 5-speed manual gearbox. This car also had both front and rear disc brakes. The suspension was a
            semi-trailing ring arm setup and minor aerodynamic parts were added. <br> <br>

            This model of the GT-R was also known as the Kenmeri Skyline, due to a popular advertisement featuring a
            young
            couple (Ken and Mary) enjoying the Hokkaido countryside. The advertisement later spawned a hit song by Buzz,
            and
            the tree featured in the advertisement later became a minor star itself. [citation needed] <br> <br>

            The second generation GT-R was unsuccessful, as the 1973 oil crisis reduced demand for high-performance
            sports
            cars.[16] A total of 197 cars were built by the end of its short production run. For the next decade, this
            was
            the last GT-R until the production of the R32 in 1989. <br> <br>
