        <h1>Fourth generation (1995-1998)</h1>
        <p>The E-BCNR33 (R33) was developed even as the non GT-R R33 models went on sale in August 1993 (with a
            prototype being shown at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show) for release in 1995 as a successor to the R32 model. The
            engine in the R33 was nearly identical to the R32. It used the same turbochargers and the same specification
            for the manual gearbox, although the syncros were stronger. The engine corrected the R32's weak oil pump
            drive collar, which tended to fail in higher power applications, by using a wider collar (also fixed in spec
            2 R32's prior to R33 release). The base model of the R33 GT-R weighs 1,540 kg (3,395 lb). <br> <br>

            The R33 GT-R went on sale on 6 January 1995 with the base model GT-R and the V·Spec model. The V·Spec model
            weighed in 10 kg (22 lb) heavier, and had sportier suspension resulting in lower ground clearance. The
            V·Spec also featured the newer ATTESA E-TS Pro all wheel drive system, which included an Active Limited Slip
            differential.

            differential. <br> <br>

            At the same time as the introduction of the R33 GT-R and GT-R V·Spec, Nissan introduced the R33 GT-R V·Spec
            N1 model. Changes made to the R33 N1 are similar to those in the R32 N1. The car was made lighter by
            removing the ABS, air conditioning, sound system, rear wiper, and boot carpet. The R33 GT-R V·Spec N1
            received the slightly revised R33 N1 engine. <br> <br>

            The R33 ended production on 9 November 1998. The last R33 GT-R produced was a V-Spec in GV1 finished in
            Black Pearl colour. <br> <br>

            Before the official release of the R33, Nissan recorded a lap time for the R33 GT-R at the Nürburgring
            Nordschleife, driven by Dirk Schoysman, car set a lap time of 7:59.887 minutes, became the first production
            vehicle to break into the sub 8 minute mark.[41] Also the, fastest production vehicle around the track. In
            1999, the record was broken by a Skyline GT-R R34. <br> <br>

            In 1995, Best Motoring conducted a test of the GT-R R33 at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. Driven by Motoharu
            Kurosawa, the car set a 8:01.72 minute lap time around the track. <br> <br>
