        <h1>Third generation (1989-1994)</h1>
        <p>
            After discontinuing the Skyline GT-R in 1973, Nissan revived the GT-R nameplate again in 1989. At the time
            Nissan was competing in Group A Racing with the Skyline GTS-R. Nissan wanted to retire the GTS-R in favor of
            a more competitive vehicle. The new generation of the GT-R, E-BNR32 chassis (commonly shortened to R32), was
            designed to dominate Group A class racing. <br> <br>

            Nissan Kohki (Nissan's power train engineering and manufacturing facility) originally tested a twin
            turbocharged 2.4 L (2,350 cc) bored and stroked version of the RB20 engine. This set up resulted in a power
            output of 233 kW (317 PS; 312 hp) and used a rear wheel drive drivetrain. Under Group A regulations, a
            turbocharged engine must multiply its engine displacement by 1.7, putting the new Skyline in the 4,000 cc
            class, and requiring the use of 10-inch-wide tyres. Knowing that they would be required to use 10-inch-wide
            tyres, Nissan decided to make the car all wheel drive. Nissan developed a special motorsport-oriented AWD
            system for this purpose called the ATTESA E-TS. Although this assisted with traction, it made the car 100 kg
            (220 lb) heavier; the added weight put the GT-R at a disadvantage to other cars in the 4,000 cc class.
            Nissan then made the decision to increase the displacement to 2,600 cc, and put the car in the 4,500 cc
            class, with the car's weight near-equal to competing cars. The 4,500 cc class also allowed for 11-inch-wide
            tyres. New engine block and heads were then developed to better match the increased displacement. The result
            was a car that had a power output of 441 kW (600 PS; 592 hp).[18] Later REINIK (Racing & Rally Engineering
            Division Incorporated Nissan Kohi) produced Group A racing engines rated between 373–485 kW (507–659 PS;
            500–650 hp)[19] depending on track conditions. <br> <br>

            This new 2,568 cc (2.6 L) RB26DETT-powered all wheel drive concept was put into production as the R32 Nissan
            Skyline GT-R. The R32 developed 206 kW (280 PS; 276 hp) at 6,800 rpm and 260 lb⋅ft (353 N⋅m) of torque at
            4,400 rpm,[13][20][21] it had a curb weight of 1,430 kg (3,150 lb). Nissan officially started its production
            run 21 August 1989,[22] and began its Group A campaign in 1990. <br> <br>

            The Skyline GT-R Nismo, identified by the model code suffix "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and
            attracted a premium of ¥235,500 over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related
            to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a
            production run of 500 units, under the "Evolution" special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced
            and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, rising the production total to 560 units.[23] Aerodynamic changes
            include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve
            airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats,
            and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which is
            not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front panels are aluminium in all
            GT-R models rather than the standard steel in non GT-R models, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo
            weighs 1,400 kg (3,086 lb) compared to 1,430 kg (3,153 lb) for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71
            in 225/55R16 fitted to 16-inch alloy wheels. Mechanically, the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the
            'standard' GT-R but replaces the standard Garrett T03 turbo chargers with larger T04B models, sacrificing
            the faster spool up of the ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo
            was only available in colour code KH2 "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a
            circular "Nismo" logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard
            console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available
            included a 260 km/h (162 mph) speedometer, 3-inch cat-back exhaust system, front suspension tower brace,
            sports shock absorbers, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with a built-in third brake light. <br>
