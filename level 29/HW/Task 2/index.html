            <h1>Writing</h1>
            <p>
                Writing is the act of creating a persistent representation of human language. A writing system uses a
                set of symbols and rules to encode aspects of spoken language, such as its lexicon and syntax. However,
                written language may take on characteristics distinct from those of any spoken language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing is a cognitive and social activity involving neuropsychological and physical processes. The
                outcome of this activity, also called "writing", and sometimes a "text", is a series of physically
                inscribed, mechanically transferred, or digitally represented symbols. The interpreter or activator of a
                text is called a "reader".
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, writing systems do not constitute languages in and of themselves, but rather a means of
                encoding language such that it can be read by others across time and space.[3][4] While not all
                languages use a writing system, those that do can complement and extend the capacities of spoken
                language by creating durable forms of language that can be transmitted across space (e.g. written
                correspondence) and stored over time (e.g. libraries or other public records).[5] Writing can also have
                knowledge-transforming effects, since it allows humans to externalize their thinking in forms that are
                easier to reflect on, elaborate on, reconsider, and revise.

            <h2>Tools, materials, and motivations to write</h2>
            <p>
                Any instance of writing involves a complex interaction among available tools, intentions, cultural
                customs, cognitive routines, genres, tacit and explicit knowledge, and the constraints and limitations
                of the writing system(s) deployed.[9] Inscriptions have been made with fingers, styluses, quills, ink
                brushes, pencils, pens, and many styles of lithography; surfaces used for these inscriptions include
                stone tablets, clay tablets, bamboo slats, papyrus, wax tablets, vellum, parchment, paper, copperplate,
                slate, porcelain, and other enameled surfaces. The Incas used knotted cords known as quipu (or khipu)
                for keeping records.
            </p>
            <p>The typewriter and subsequently various digital word processors have recently become widespread writing
                tools, and studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with
                such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.</p>
            <p>
                Advancements in natural language processing and natural language generation have resulted in software
                capable of producing certain forms of formulaic writing (e.g., weather forecasts and brief sports
                reporting) without the direct involvement of humans[12] after initial configuration or, more commonly,
                to be used to support writing processes such as generating initial drafts, producing feedback with the
                help of a rubric, copy-editing, and helping translation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Writing technologies from different eras coexist easily in many homes and workplaces. During the course
                of a day or even a single episode of writing, for example, a writer might instinctively switch among a
                pencil, a touchscreen, a text-editor, a whiteboard, a legal pad, and adhesive notes as different
                purposes arise.

            <h2>Motivations and purposes</h2>
            <p>
                As human societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by
                pragmatic exigencies like keeping track of produce and other wealth, recording history, maintaining
                culture, codifying knowledge through curricula and lists of texts deemed to contain foundational
                knowledge (e.g. The Canon of Medicine) or artistic value (e.g. the literary canon), organizing and
                governing societies through texts including legal codes, census records, contracts, deeds of ownership,
                taxation, trade agreements, and treaties.[17] As Charles Bazerman explains, the "marking of signs on
                stones, clay, paper, and now digital memories—each more portable and rapidly traveling than the
                previous—provided means for increasingly coordinated and extended action as well as memory across larger
                groups of people over time and space."[18] For example, around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of
                trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable
                method for creating permanent records of transactions.[19] On the other hand, writing in both ancient
                Egypt and Mesoamerica may have evolved through the political necessity to manage the calendar for
                recording historical and environmental events.[20][21] Further innovations included more uniform,
                predictable, and widely dispersed legal systems, the distribution of accessible versions of sacred
                texts, and furthering practices of scientific inquiry and knowledge management, all of which were
                largely reliant on portable and easily reproducible forms of inscribed language. The history of writing
                is co-extensive with uses of writing and the elaboration of activity systems that give rise to and
                circulate writing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Individual motivations for writing include improvised additional capacity for the limitations of human
                memory[22] (e.g. to-do lists, recipes, reminders, logbooks, maps, the proper sequence for a complicated
                task or important ritual), dissemination of ideas and coordination (e.g. essays, monographs, broadsides,
                plans, petitions, or manifestos), creativity and storytelling, maintaining kinship and other social
                networks,[23] business correspondence regarding goods and services, and life writing (e.g. a diary or
                journal).
            </p>
            <p>
                The global spread of digital communication systems such as e-mail and social media has made writing an
                increasingly important feature of daily life, where these systems mix with older technologies like
                paper, pencils, whiteboards, printers, and copiers.[25] Substantial amounts of everyday writing
                characterize most workplaces in developed countries.[26] In many occupations (e.g. law, accounting,
                software design, human resources), written documentation is not only the main deliverable but also the
                mode of work itself.[27] Even in occupations not typically associated with writing, routine records
                management has most employees writing at least some of the time.
