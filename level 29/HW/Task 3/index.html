            <h1>Python</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>The Pythonidae</strong>, commonly known as pythons, are a family of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and
                Australia. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Ten genera and 39 species are
                currently recognized. Being naturally non-venomous, pythons must constrict their prey to induce cardiac
                arrest prior to consumption. Pythons will typically strike at and bite their prey of choice to gain hold
                of it; they then must use physical strength to constrict their prey, by coiling their muscular bodies
                around the animal, effectively suffocating it before swallowing whole. This is in stark contrast to
                venomous snakes such as the rattlesnake, for example, which delivers a swift, venomous bite but
                releases, waiting as the prey succumbs to envenomation before being consumed. Collectively, the pythons
                are well-documented and studied as constrictors, much like other non-venomous snakes, including the boas
                and even kingsnakes of the New World.
            </p>

                <strong>Pythons</strong> are found in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia, with invasive
                populations of Burmese pythons in Everglades National Park, Florida and reticulated pythons in Puerto
                Rico. They are ambush predators that primarily kill prey by constriction, causing cardiac arrest.
                Pythons are oviparous, laying eggs that females incubate until they hatch. They possess premaxillary
                teeth, with the exception of adults in the Australian genus Aspidites.[3][4] While many species are
                available in the exotic pet trade, caution is needed with larger species due to potential danger. The
                taxonomy of pythons has evolved, and they are now more closely related to sunbeam snakes and the Mexican
                burrowing python.

                <strong>Pythons</strong> are poached for their meat and skin, leading to a billion-dollar global trade. They can carry
                diseases, such as salmonella and leptospirosis, which can be transmitted to humans. Pythons are also
                used in African traditional medicine to treat ailments like rheumatism and mental illnesses. Their body
                parts, including blood and organs, are believed to have various healing properties. In some African
                cultures, pythons have significant roles in folklore and mythology, often symbolizing strength or having
                sacred status.

            <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Pythons</strong> are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia,
                southeastern Pakistan, southern China, the Philippines and Australia.

                Two known populations of invasive pythons exist in the Western Hemisphere. In the United States, an
                introduced population of Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) has existed as an invasive species in
                Everglades National Park since the late 1990s. As of January 2023, estimates place the Floridian Burmese
                python population at around half a million. Local bounties are awarded and scientists study dead Burmese
                pythons to better understand breeding cycles and trends associated with rapid population explosion. The
                pythons readily prey on native North American fauna in Florida, including (but not limited to) American
                alligators, birds, bobcats, American bullfrogs, opossums, raccoons, river otters, white-tailed deer, and
                occasionally domestic pets and livestock. They are also known to prey on other invasive and introduced
                animals to Florida, such as the green iguana and nutria (coypu), though not at a rate as to lower their
                numbers rapidly or effectively.

                In Puerto Rico, a population of reticulated pythons (Malayopython reticulatus) are known to be currently
                established, with a remarkably high rate of albinism, suggesting establishment from domesticated pet
                stock. Records of reticulated pythons date back to as early as 2009, and the population was recognized
                as established by 2017.

            <h2>Feeding</h2>
            <p>
                Most members of this family are ambush predators, in that they typically remain motionless in a
                camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. Attacks on humans, although known to
                occur, are extremely rare.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Pythons</strong> use their sharp, backward-curving teeth, four rows in the upper jaw, two in the lower, to grasp
                prey which is then killed by constriction; after an animal has been grasped to restrain it, the python
                quickly wraps a number of coils around it.[9][10] Death occurs primarily by cardiac arrest.[9][10] Even
                the larger species, such as the reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), do not crush their prey
                to death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Larger specimens usually eat animals about the size of a domestic cat, but larger food items are known;
                some large Asian species have been known to take down adult deer, and the Central African rock python
                (<strong>Python</strong> sebae) has been known to eat antelope. The reticulated python is the only python species known
                to sometimes eat humans in its natural habitat in Sulawesi, Indonesia.[12] All prey is swallowed whole,
                and may take several days or even weeks to fully digest.
