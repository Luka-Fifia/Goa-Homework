                <p>
                    Pirates of the Caribbean is an American fantasy supernatural swashbuckler film series produced by
                    Jerry
                    Bruckheimer and based on Walt Disney's theme park attraction of the same name. The film series
                    serves as
                    a major component of the titular media franchise. Based on a fictionalized version of the Golden Age
                    of
                    Piracy (c. 1650–1726), the films' plots are set primarily in the Caribbean.

                    Directors of the series include Gore Verbinski (films 1–3), Rob Marshall (4), Joachim Rønning (5),
                    and
                    Espen Sandberg (5). The series is primarily written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other
                    writers
                    include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5).

                    The stories follow the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), with Hector Barbossa
                    (Geoffrey
                    Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) over the course of the films. Other characters featured in
                    the
                    original trilogy include Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), James
                    Norrington (Jack Davenport), Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), Pintel and Ragetti (Lee
                    Arenberg
                    and Mackenzie Crook), Marty (Martin Klebba), Cotton (David Bailie), Murtogg and Mullroy (Giles New
                    and
                    Angus Barnett), Lieutenant Gillette (Damian O'Hare), Theodore Groves (Greg Ellis), Bootstrap Bill
                    Turner
                    (Stellan Skarsgård), Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Davy Jones
                    (Bill
                    Nighy), and Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Despite focusing more on Jack Sparrow among several of the
                    aforementioned characters, the fourth and fifth films serve as standalone sequels. The fourth film
                    features Angelica (Penélope Cruz), Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), Syrena
                    (Àstrid
                    Bergès-Frisbey), and Scrum (Stephen Graham). The fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier
                    Bardem),
                    Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario).

                <h2>Untitled sixth film</h2>
                <p>
                    Shortly before the release of On Stranger Tides, it was reported that Disney was planning to shoot
                    the
                    fifth and the sixth films back-to-back,[4] although ultimately only the fifth installment was
                    developed.
                    By March 2017, director Joachim Rønning stated that Dead Men Tell No Tales was only the beginning of
                    the
                    final adventure, confirming that it would not be the last film of the series.[5] That September,
                    producer Jerry Bruckheimer indicated that another Pirates of the Caribbean was still in development.
                    <br> <br>

                    In October of the same year, Kaya Scodelario stated that she was contractually signed to return for
                    a
                    sixth film.[7] It was confirmed that Rønning would direct the film.[8] In October 2019, Disney
                    announced
                    that Craig Mazin and Ted Elliott would write Pirates of the Caribbean 6.[9][10] In May 2020,
                    Bruckheimer
                    commented that the first draft of the screenplay for the sixth film would soon be finished.[11] On
                    April
                    20, 2022, during his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp stated he had no intention
                    of
                    returning to the franchise, citing his strained relationship with Disney after they had removed him
                    from
                    the franchise before a verdict was reached in the case. <br> <br>


                    In February 2023, Orlando Bloom had expressed interest in returning to the franchise.[14][15][16] In
                    March, Keira Knightley explained to Entertainment Tonight why she would not make a return to the
                    Disney
                    franchise. "What about Elizabeth Swann?", Knightley joked when asked if she would re-join the crew,
                    also
                    commenting that her character sailed away "in brilliant style".[17] Bruckheimer was also still
                    interested in potentially bringing back Depp to the saga.[18][19] In June, Depp was reportedly open
                    to
                    returning to the series if the project proves worthwhile.[20] <br> <br>
                    In August 2023, Craig Mazin stated that he'd pitched a Pirates script to Disney, but that he would
                    only
                    commit to it if he was able to work with Ted Elliot; Mazin confirmed that his and Elliot's script
                    was
                    bought by Disney, also commenting that it was "too weird", but the 2023 Writers Guild of America
                    strike
                    had slowed production of the sixth installment. <br> <br>

                <h2>Short film</h2>
                <p>
                    Pirates of the Caribbean: Tales of the Code: Wedlocked is a live-action short directed by James Ward
                    Byrkit.[34] There were many proposed titles, including Wedding Belles[35] and Pirate Belles.[36]
                    Although it was only included as a special feature in the US 15-disc 3D Blu-ray/2D Blu-ray/DVD +
                    Digital
                    Copy box set that includes the first four films released on October 18, 2011,[37] it was also
                    released
                    in the similar UK five-disc set. Jim Byrkit conceived the idea for a short film while on the
                    Shipwreck
                    Cove set Rick Heinrichs designed for Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), a project
                    which
                    interested Brigham Taylor at Disney. Screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio collaborated with
                    Byrkit
                    on the script, having envisioned something based on the Pirate Code Book as a device that could tie
                    into
                    other stories later. The short film was shot by cinematographer Nic Sadler. As the pirate cove sets
                    from
                    At World's End—where the short film takes place—were set to be demolished, the short project was
                    prepped
                    in a matter of days and shot over three days in late 2006.[35][38] In 2023, Rossio wrote on Wordplay
                    that Tales of the Code was designed to be a series of a few fun shorts to fill in the Pirates
                    universe
                    and add to the DVD extras section. He also said that, in addition to Wedlocked, there are a few
                    scripts
                    around that were a part of that process. <br> <br>

                    The short film Wedlocked serves as a prequel to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black
                    Pearl,
                    inspired by the auction scene in the Disneyland attraction. Two wenches believe they are both
                    betrothed
                    to Jack Sparrow, but he has secretly traded them to the auctioneer for a fancy hat. They think the
                    auctioneer is raising money for them, when in actuality they are being sold as brides to the highest
                    bidder. Wedlocked had several Pirates veterans reprise their roles, like Vanessa Branch as Giselle,
                    Lauren Maher as Scarlett, and David Bailie reprising his role as Cotton. The 10 minute short also
                    featured John Vickery as the auctioneer and Dale Dickey as Oona the wench, as well as three
                    pirates—Marquis D’avis, Atencio, and Slurry Gibson—who are named after Marc Davis, Xavier Atencio,
                    and
                    Blaine Gibson, the Imagineers who worked on the original attraction.
