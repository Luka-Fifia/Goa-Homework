        Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while
        maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner or a turn. The technique causes the
        rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the
        opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as
        opposite lock or counter-steering). Drifting is traditionally performed using three methods: clutch kicking
        (where the clutch is rapidly disengaged and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting the grip of the rear
        wheels), weight transfer (using techniques such as the Scandinavian flick), and employing a handbrake turn. This
        sense of drift is not to be confused with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering technique established in
        Grand Prix and sports car racing.
